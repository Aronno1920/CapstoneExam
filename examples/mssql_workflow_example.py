The First Law (Law of Inertia) states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue moving at constant velocity in a straight line, unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force. For example, passengers in a car feel pushed back when the car accelerates, or they continue moving forward when the car suddenly stops. The law emphasizes that force is required to change an object's state of motion.

The Second Law establishes the mathematical relationship between force, mass, and acceleration: F = ma (Force equals mass times acceleration). This means that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. For example, it takes more force to accelerate a heavy truck than a light car to the same speed.

The Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. These action-reaction force pairs act on different objects simultaneously. When you walk, you push backward against the ground (action), and the ground pushes forward on you with equal force (reaction), propelling you forward. This principle explains how rockets work in space.""",

First Law (Inertia): Objects at rest stay at rest, and moving objects keep moving at the same speed unless a force acts on them. Like when you're in a car that suddenly stops - you keep moving forward because of inertia.

Second Law (F=ma): The force on an object equals its mass times acceleration. Heavier objects need more force to speed up. This is why it's harder to push a full shopping cart than an empty one.

Third Law (Action-Reaction): Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. When I jump, I push down on the ground and it pushes up on me with the same force. Rockets work this way - they push gas down and get pushed up."""
